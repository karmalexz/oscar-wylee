## TO-DO list

- There can be a tablet view.
- Though the test does not require me to make it dynamic, but I think it is cool to finish this simple webpage with some javascript as well-especially for the hamburger icon.
- Some css logic can be refined.
- Due to the time, the file structure is really bad, I will fix it up once I have a chance.

## Installation

You can either `clone` or dowoload the zip file.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
